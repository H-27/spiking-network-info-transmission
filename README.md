# spiking-network-info-transmission
This project investigates information flow in multi-layer spiking neural networks. We'll compare feedforward-only architectures with those including horizontal, within-layer connections. By measuring spike rates, synchrony, and sparsity, we'll determine how recurrence impacts reliable signal propagation and neural coding across network layers.
